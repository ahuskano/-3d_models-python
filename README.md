=================

The goal of the project was to show how bending surface in the direction of the normal can help us to get a new surface with very interesting relief.
For realization of that project I used programming language Python and its modules NumPy for mathematical functions and Mayavi for scene. I have created five toruses and put them to XY plane of the coordinate system. The scene consists of: torus with fixed radius, torus with variable radius, one with bending, and two toruses with random bending.
